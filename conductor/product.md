# Product Guide

## Initial Concept
**Kintsu (Kintsugi)**: "Don't just list it. Prove it."

## Vision
Kintsu is a **reactive "Digital Refinery"** and forensic data recovery platform for survivors of catastrophic property loss (fire, flood, hurricane). It is designed for the "Unprepared Survivor" who has no backup inventory. It ingests "digital debris" (receipts, bank statements, photos) to reconstruct a "Golden Record" of lost assets, functioning as an automated "Digital Public Adjuster."

## Core Value Proposition
- **Reactive vs. Proactive:** Unlike *Sortly* (requires pre-disaster effort), Kintsu works *after* the disaster.
- **BYOS (Bring Your Own Storage):** Zero-trust architecture where the user's Google Drive is the database. Kintsu is a transient processing layer.
- **The Kintsugi Metaphor:** Repairing the shattered "vessel" of a home with gold (proof), making the claim stronger than memory alone.

## The Kintsu Recovery Method (Phases)
1.  **Phase 1: Stabilization (Days 1-14):** Immediate cash flow (ALE) tracking. Quick wins to build trust.
2.  **Phase 2: The Raw Data Dump (Weeks 2-4):** Low-effort ingestion of CSVs (Amazon), PDFs (Bank Statements), and Photos into "The Hopper" (Google Drive).
3.  **Phase 3: Reconstruction (Month 2):** Voice-First walkthroughs ("Close your eyes, what's in the bathroom?") verified against extracted data.
4.  **Phase 4: The Inference Engine (Month 3):** "Orphaned Accessory" logic (e.g., "Pool chemicals found -> You must have a Pool Pump").

## User Personas
- **The Unprepared Survivor:** Trauma-affected, overwhelmed, suffering from decision fatigue.
- **The Adjuster:** Needs verified, structured data, not emotional estimates.
