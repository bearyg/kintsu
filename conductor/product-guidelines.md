# Product Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
**"Premium Resilience"**
The UI should feel like a "Digital Vault"—secure, banking-grade, yet empathetic. It manages "Trauma Brain" by reducing cognitive load.

## Visual Identity
*   **Primary Color (Kintsugi Gold):** `#C9A75D` (Represents value, hope, and the "mend").
*   **Secondary Color (Deep Trust Blue):** `#1A2B45` (Represents security, banking-grade trust).
*   **Supporting Colors:** Ash Grey (`#5F6B7A`) and Off-White (`#F8F9FA`).

## UI Metaphors
*   **Progress:** "Cracks" filling with liquid gold.
*   **Processing:** "Coalescence"—shards of data floating together to form a whole.
*   **Empty State:** A faint outline of a broken vessel waiting to be filled.

## Architectural Guidelines
*   **Privacy-First / Serverless:** Kintsu does not persist sensitive financial data. It acts as a "Refinery" pipeline.
*   **Folder Structure (User's Drive):**
    *   `/Raw_Ore` (Ingestion)
    *   `/Refinery` (Processing)
    *   `/Golden_Record` (Final Exports)
